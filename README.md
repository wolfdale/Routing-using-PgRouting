Routing-using-PgRouting
=======================
The project explores one of the famous problems in the mathematical disciplines of graph theory and the geographic information systems (GIS) to find out the shortest path between the two nodes. The project explores algorithms to demonstrate, calculate & visualize the shortest path between any two nodes of Road network. Network Analysis is performed on Geospatial data in the form of shapefile (.shp format).
The project also explores the various plug-in in QGIS software Environment which includes DB Manager, SPIT & Road Graph Plug-In. 
### Software Configuration
       
•	PostgreSQL (9.3.4 Stable): It is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) acting as backend in our project.
•	QGIS (2.0.1. Stable): It is a cross-platform free and open source desktop geographic information system (GIS) application that                         provides data viewing, editing, and analysis capabilities.
•	PostGIS (2.1 Stable): It provides spatial objects for the PostgreSQL database, allowing storage and query of information about                         location and mapping.
•	PgRouting (2.0 Stable): It extends the PostGIS  geospatial database to provide geospatial routing functionality & Network                               Analysis




#### IMPORTANT NOTES ####
*The Detailed Guide in this repo explains how to set up the PostgreSQL,QGIS Environments & PgRouting And PostGIS packages.
