=======================
The project explores one of the famous problems in the mathematical disciplines of graph theory and the geographic information systems (GIS) to find out the shortest path between the two nodes. The project explores algorithms to demonstrate, calculate & visualize the shortest path between any two nodes of Road network. Network Analysis is performed on Geospatial data in the form of shapefile (.shp format).
The project also explores the various plug-in in QGIS software Environment which includes DB Manager, SPIT & Road Graph Plug-In.
